# Service Account Key:
# You must provide your Google Service Account key.
# It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to store the JSON key content in an environment variable
# for production environments, rather than directly in this file or a file path.

# Option 1: Provide the JSON key content directly from an environment variable.
# This is the most secure and recommended approach for production.

# Option 2: Provide the path to your service account JSON key file.
# Use this only if environment variables are not feasible.
