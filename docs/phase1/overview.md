# Phase 1: MVP - Accurate and Up-to-Date Information

## 1. Goal

The primary goal of Phase 1 is to validate that the data crawler can accurately and reliably extract information from Git, Google Drive, and HTTP endpoints.

## 2. Scope

This phase will focus on implementing the core data extraction and update mechanisms for the following data sources:

*   Git repositories
*   Google Drive
*   HTTP endpoints

## 3. Key Features

*   **Git Integration:** Extract data from Git repositories, including commit messages, file content, and branch information.
*   **Google Drive Integration:** Extract data from Google Drive, including document content, file metadata, and folder structure.
*   **HTTP Endpoint Integration:** Extract data from HTTP endpoints, including JSON and HTML content.
*   **Data Transformation:** Transform the extracted data into a consistent format for storage and search.
*   **Update Mechanism:** Implement webhooks or polling to keep the data up-to-date.

## 4. Out of Scope

*   Advanced search capabilities.
*   Support for additional data sources.
*   User interface for managing data sources.

## 5. Success Metrics

*   Accuracy of data extraction (measured by comparing extracted data with source data).
*   Timeliness of data updates (measured by the delay between source data changes and updates in the knowledge base).
*   Number of data sources successfully integrated.

## 6. Risks and Assumptions

*   Data source APIs may change, requiring updates to the data extraction logic.
*   Network connectivity issues may impact data updates.

## 7. Future Considerations

*   Implement advanced search capabilities.
*   Support additional data sources.
*   Develop a user interface for managing data sources.
