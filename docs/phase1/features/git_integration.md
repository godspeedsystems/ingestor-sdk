# Feature: Git Integration

## 1. Goal

To extract data from Git repositories, including commit messages, file content, and branch information, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

## 2. User Story

As a user, I want the data crawler to automatically extract information from my Git repositories so that I can have a unified view of my code, documentation, and commit history.

## 3. The Problem

*   Information about code, documentation, and commit history is scattered across different Git repositories.
*   It is difficult to track changes and collaborate effectively.
*   Manual data collection is time-consuming and error-prone.

## 4. The Solution

The data crawler will automatically extract data from Git repositories, transform it into a consistent format, and store it in a unified knowledge base.

## 5. What this does not do?

*   Does not support all Git providers (e.g., GitLab, Bitbucket). Only supports GitHub in the MVP.
*   Does not provide advanced code analysis capabilities.
*   Does not support Git LFS (Large File Storage).

## 6. How will we solve?

*   Use the GitHub API to access repository data.
*   Implement webhooks to receive notifications of changes.
*   Store the extracted data in a structured format.

## 7. Any Special Considerations or Assumptions

*   The GitHub API is reliable and provides accurate data.
*   Webhooks are delivered promptly and reliably.
*   Users have appropriate permissions to access the Git repositories.

## 8. Impact Areas

*   Improved code visibility and collaboration.
*   Reduced time spent searching for information.
*   Better tracking of changes and commit history.

## 9. Test Cases

*   Verify that the data crawler can extract commit messages, file content, and branch information from a Git repository.
*   Verify that the data crawler can handle different types of Git repositories (e.g., public, private).
*   Verify that the data crawler can update the knowledge base when changes are made to the Git repository.

## 10. Future Improvements

*   Support for additional Git providers (e.g., GitLab, Bitbucket).
*   Advanced code analysis capabilities.
*   Support for Git LFS (Large File Storage).
