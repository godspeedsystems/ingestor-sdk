# Feature: Google Drive Integration

## 1. Goal

To extract data from Google Drive, including document content, file metadata, and folder structure, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

## 2. User Story

As a user, I want the data crawler to automatically extract information from my Google Drive so that I can have a unified view of my documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

## 3. The Problem

*   Information is scattered across different Google Drive files and folders.
*   It is difficult to find specific documents or track changes.
*   Manual data collection is time-consuming and error-prone.

## 4. The Solution

The data crawler will automatically extract data from Google Drive, transform it into a consistent format, and store it in a unified knowledge base.

## 5. What this does not do?

*   Does not support all Google Drive file types (e.g., Drawings, Maps). Only supports Docs, Sheets, and Slides in the MVP.
*   Does not provide advanced content analysis capabilities.
*   Does not support shared drives.

## 6. How will we solve?

*   Use the Google Drive API to access file and folder data.
*   Implement polling to check for changes.
*   Store the extracted data in a structured format.

## 7. Any Special Considerations or Assumptions

*   The Google Drive API is reliable and provides accurate data.
*   Polling is an acceptable method for detecting changes.
*   Users have appropriate permissions to access the Google Drive files and folders.

## 8. Impact Areas

*   Improved document visibility and collaboration.
*   Reduced time spent searching for information.
*   Better tracking of document changes and versions.

## 9. Test Cases

*   Verify that the data crawler can extract document content, file metadata, and folder structure from Google Drive.
*   Verify that the data crawler can handle different types of Google Drive files (e.g., Docs, Sheets, Slides).
*   Verify that the data crawler can update the knowledge base when changes are made to the Google Drive files.

## 10. Future Improvements

*   Support for additional Google Drive file types (e.g., Drawings, Maps).
*   Advanced content analysis capabilities.
*   Support for shared drives.
