# Feature: HTTP Endpoint Integration

## 1. Goal

To extract data from HTTP endpoints, including JSON and HTML content, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

## 2. User Story

As a user, I want the data crawler to automatically extract information from HTTP endpoints so that I can have a unified view of data from various web services and APIs.

## 3. The Problem

*   Information is scattered across different HTTP endpoints.
*   It is difficult to aggregate data from multiple sources.
*   Manual data collection is time-consuming and error-prone.

## 4. The Solution

The data crawler will automatically extract data from HTTP endpoints, transform it into a consistent format, and store it in a unified knowledge base.

## 5. What this does not do?

*   Does not support all HTTP methods (e.g., PUT, DELETE). Only supports GET in the MVP.
*   Does not provide advanced data scraping capabilities.
*   Does not handle authentication for all HTTP endpoints.

## 6. How will we solve?

*   Use the HTTP client to access data from HTTP endpoints.
*   Implement polling to check for changes.
*   Store the extracted data in a structured format.

## 7. Any Special Considerations or Assumptions

*   The HTTP endpoints are reliable and provide accurate data.
*   Polling is an acceptable method for detecting changes.
*   Users have appropriate permissions to access the HTTP endpoints.

## 8. Impact Areas

*   Improved data visibility and aggregation.
*   Reduced time spent collecting data from HTTP endpoints.
*   Better access to data from web services and APIs.

## 9. Test Cases

*   Verify that the data crawler can extract JSON and HTML content from HTTP endpoints.
*   Verify that the data crawler can handle different types of HTTP endpoints (e.g., public, private).
*   Verify that the data crawler can update the knowledge base when changes are made to the HTTP endpoints.

## 10. Future Improvements

*   Support for additional HTTP methods (e.g., PUT, DELETE).
*   Advanced data scraping capabilities.
*   Handle authentication for all HTTP endpoints.
