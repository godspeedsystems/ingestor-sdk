*   Handle errors related to webhook delivery (e.g., failed webhook events).

### 4.2. Google Drive Integration

#### 4.2.1. Detailed Description

The data crawler will extract data from Google Drive, including document content, file metadata, and folder structure. It will use the Google Drive API to access file and folder data and implement polling to check for changes. The extracted data will be stored in a structured format.

#### 4.2.2. Input/Output

*   **Input:**
    *   Google Drive account credentials
    *   Polling interval (for updates)

*   Handle errors related to polling (e.g., network connectivity issues).

### 4.3. HTTP Endpoint Integration

#### 4.3.1. Detailed Description

The data crawler will extract data from HTTP endpoints, including JSON and HTML content. It will use an HTTP client to access data from HTTP endpoints and implement polling to check for changes. The extracted data will be stored in a structured format.

#### 4.3.2. Input/Output

*   **Input:**
    *   HTTP endpoint URL
    *   Polling interval (for updates)
*   **Output:**
    *   JSON content
    *   HTML content

*   Handle errors related to polling (e.g., timeout errors).

### 4.4. Data Transformation

#### 4.4.1. Detailed Description

The data crawler will transform the extracted data into a consistent format for storage and search. This will involve mapping data fields from different sources to a common schema, handling data type conversions, and cleaning the data to remove inconsistencies.

#### 4.4.2. Input/Output

*   **Input:**
    *   Extracted data from Git, Google Drive, and HTTP endpoints
*   **Output:**
    *   Transformed data in a consistent format

#### 4.4.3. Error Handling

*   Handle errors related to data mapping (e.g., missing fields, invalid data types).
*   Handle errors related to data conversion (e.g., incompatible data types).

### 4.5. Update Mechanism

#### 4.5.1. Detailed Description

The data crawler will implement webhooks (for Git) and polling (for Google Drive and HTTP endpoints) to keep the data up-to-date. Webhooks will provide real-time notifications of changes, while polling will periodically check for updates.

#### 4.5.2. Input/Output

*   **Input:**
    *   Webhook events (from Git)
    *   Polling interval (for Google Drive and HTTP endpoints)
*   **Output:**
    *   Updated data in the knowledge base

#### 4.5.3. Error Handling

*   Handle errors related to webhook delivery (e.g., failed webhook events).
*   Handle errors related to polling (e.g., network connectivity issues, timeout errors).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1. Performance

The data crawler should be able to extract and transform data from all sources within a reasonable timeframe. The update mechanism should ensure that data is updated frequently enough to maintain accuracy. Specific performance metrics will be defined during the testing phase.

### 5.2. Security

The data crawler should protect sensitive data, such as API keys and credentials. It should also prevent unauthorized access to the knowledge base.

### 5.3. Scalability

The data crawler should be able to scale to handle a large number of data sources and a large volume of data.

### 5.4. Reliability

The data crawler should be reliable and resilient to failures. It should be able to recover from errors and continue operating without data loss.

## 6. Data Model

### 6.1. Data Entities
