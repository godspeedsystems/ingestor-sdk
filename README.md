
 ## Repository Structure (Branch: `Ingestor`)

This branch contains **two main folders**:

1. **`Ingestor/`**
   - Contains the **actual implementation code** for the Ingestor.
   - All core functionalities, modules, and logic reside here.

2. **`scheduler-sdk (simulated)/`**
   - Contains **simulated scheduler-related files**.
   - Each file has an **accompanying PDF** that:
     - Explains the purpose and current implementation of the file.
     - Documents **what is done** so far.
     - Lists **future scope** and pending tasks.

---
**Note:** The `scheduler-sdk` here is a **simulation** / lightweight (no DB persistence) setup to demonstrate the working of the Crawler SDK.
